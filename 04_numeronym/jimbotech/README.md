# Lab 4 - Numeronym

Lab exerciser for the ANZ go course that involves converting words to numeronyms, which are number-based words. As this is a vague definition, I chose to follow the rules from this web site:Â https://www.revolvy.com/page/Numeronym.
It may be overkill, but I'm running with it, not least because converting "I love you" to 143 is just fun.
