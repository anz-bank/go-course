# Fibonacci Number Generator
## Overview
As part of the ANZ "go" course the first lab is to produce a piece of software that will produce the Fibonacci series for fib(7). It was also an exercise in the tour.golang.org.

Generating the series was implemented as "closure" which was a requirement in the tour-golang . There are other ways to solve this problem, but I kept it as an example of closure for later reference.

The function maintains state and hence has to be called sequentially.
